# Automated Water Supply Model

[![DOI](https://readthedocs.org/projects/awsm/badge/)](https://awsm.readthedocs.io)


Automated Water Supply Model (AWSM) was developed at
the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in Boise, ID. AWSM was designed to
streamline the workflow used by the ARS to forecast the water supply of multiple
water basins. AWSM standardizes the steps needed to distribute met. data with
SMRF, run an energy and mass balance with iSnobal, and process the results,
while maintaining the flexibility of each program.
